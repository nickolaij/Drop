# Drop.
A game about herding your opponent.

The game rules can be found [here](Drop.pdf).

A printable version of the board is avaliable in [Colour](PrintnPlay/ColourHexGrid.pdf) and [Grayscale](PrintnPlay/BWHexGrid.pdf).
You will need to provide 32 pieces for each player - I used Othello pieces with each player picking a side to use.
The "dud" piece can be represented with whatever you like.
